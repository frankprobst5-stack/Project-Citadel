# PROJECT VIGIL // Unified Smart Home Controller Kernel
# Copyright (C) 2026 SnapPress // Copyleft GNU AGPL-3.0-or-later
#
# Merges what used to be two separate files/containers -- vigil_core.py
# (device registry + relay toggle, ran as the "vigil-hub" container) and
# vigil_hub.py (solar/security telemetry, ran as the confusingly-named
# "vigil-power" container) -- into one real service, decided 2026-09-13
# (ROADMAP.md Phase D). Reasons: the file/container names were swapped
# in a way that was already confusing (vigil-hub ran vigil_core.py;
# vigil-power ran vigil_hub.py), the standalone project-vigil repo had
# already evolved a real automation loop (load-shedding, tripline-
# triggered lighting) here that the embedded two-file split never had,
# and that automation logic needs the SAME device registry it's meant to
# control, not a second disconnected state file.
#
# Also replaces the standalone repo's `blast_local_hardware_command` --
# a raw UDP packet with a made-up string command to a hardcoded fake IP,
# not any real protocol -- with a real adapter registry against actual
# documented local APIs (Tasmota, Shelly Gen1/Gen2, ESPHome, Zigbee2MQTT;
# see ADAPTERS below). None of these adapters have been verified against
# real physical hardware as of this writing (no such hardware owned) --
# each is written and cited directly against that project's own official
# API docs (checked 2026-09-13, not guessed), for real testers who do
# have the hardware to try them against and report back what breaks.
#
# Explicitly NOT supported, and not planned: Blink and SimpliSafe. Both
# are closed cloud ecosystems with no supported local API -- this isn't
# a gap to close, it's a hardware category to steer people away from.
